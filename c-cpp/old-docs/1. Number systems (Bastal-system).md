The way to easiest understand numeric systems to to take a look our most natural ones first:
## Decimal
The decimal system, which signifies the number 10.

Can be broken down to the base number as 10, then the position as the exponent.
Adding the numbers together gives our regular numbers.
## Binary
Now reflecting this to the binary number system, all bases start at 2.

Since we only got 1 and 0, we can easily add the positional values together by ignoring those that are empty.

## Hexadecimal

The hexadecimal (Base 16) system, uses the letters a-f to signify the value of 11-15.
Notice that 15 is the max, as 0 is also a part of the range, same as 9 is the max symbol of 10, 1 is the max symbol of binary.

Hexadecimals are pretty commonly used since they can represent a byte with only 2 letter. Its easy to be able to see all 4 bits mentally by simply subtracting 8,4,2,1 in order to see which ones are set. A single 4 bit collection is also called a nibble or half byte.

## Octal

The octal (Base 8) number system is rarely used but is good to know about.

## Signed and Unsigned

In CPUs, all whole number ranges has a fixed sized. By default a number is seen as **Unsigned**, 
being from 0 to the max value of the slots (usually its (BaseNumber^SymbolCount - 1).

A **signed** number indicates that you split a the range in the middle giving almost equal range in the negative and positive range. however since 0 also is a number, it ends up being that the negative number gets an extra digit.

So a signed 8 bit value would have the range -128 to 127

#### Things to look out for
 - Going above or below the max range will cause values to roll from its highest to lowest value. because it tries to access a new position that doesnt exist. Known as integer overflow or underflow based on direction..
- subtracting a signed integer with a unsigned can overflow quickly.
- generally subtraction is preffered to use signed integers for less error margins.
- Unsigned integers are usually used for loops or bitwise storage, anything that usually just points one direction.
